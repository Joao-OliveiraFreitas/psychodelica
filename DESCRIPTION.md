This was my very first website, developed in late 2020 while I was mastering the fundamentals of web development. 
Inspired by a friend who was starting his journey into music production, I built this platform to showcase his original tracks. 
Despite its simplicity—built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3—the project was entered into a competition for a Robotics and Algorithms course, marking the beginning of my path as a developer.
